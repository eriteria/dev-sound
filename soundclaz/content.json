{"Content": "<p class=\"h5 mb-grid-gutter mb-sm-5\">Let&rsquo;s travel back in time to 1971. We&rsquo;re going to meet a Portland University student named Carolyn Davidson. We tell her we want a logo, one that represents &lsquo;movement&rsquo;. She agrees. After about 17.5 hours of work, she comes to us and presents a tick sign. &lsquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rsquo;, we say, &lsquo;just a tick? I mean where&rsquo;s the dazzling font, surrealistic pictures, elaborate emojis or something? &rsquo; Well that&rsquo;s what our hypothetical avatar might do, but not Phil Knight, Nike&rsquo;s founder.</p>\n\n<p class=\"h5 mb-grid-gutter mb-sm-5\">He didn&rsquo;t like it, for reasons obvious to us, but he decided to stick with it, for reasons not so obvious to us. Today, that simple &lsquo;tick&rsquo; is now widely known as the Nike Swoosh; and I bet you can&rsquo;t mention any other tick as notable as that one(the ones on your school homework don&rsquo;t count).</p>\n\n<p class=\"h5 mb-grid-gutter mb-sm-5\"><img alt=\"Blog image\" class=\"mb-grid-gutter mb-sm-5 rounded\" src=\"/static/img/creative-agency/logo/nike.png\" /></p>\n\n<p class=\"h5 mb-grid-gutter mb-sm-5\">So what happened? How did something so mundane, so simple, become so relevant today? Well here&rsquo;s our answer. Nike built the logo into what it is today. The logo is a symbol of the brand, but not the brand itself. So what is? Well, we don&rsquo;t know about you, but when we see Nike, we think of two things, quality products and unforgettable stories. The product and superb customer service acquainted people with the Swoosh. The more they came back, the more they connected with it as Nike continued to perform beyond expectations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"h5 mb-grid-gutter mb-sm-5\">We recently pitched three logo designs to a client for his barbershop. Obviously he was reluctant to pick one, maybe it was the fear of missing out on other possible designs. He wanted something perfect, something like the Mona Lisa on steroids. He was predisposed to the mindset that the logo represented everything about the brand, well he&rsquo;s not exactly wrong, but not exactly right either. We get a thrill off of dealing with clients like this because it forces us to challenge our assumptions as well as that of the client. We made him realise that without a brand, a logo is just a plain picture, and we know pictures may be worth a thousand words, but those words don&rsquo;t tell the whole story. We decided to tell it ourselves. We spoke about our thought process, our motivations, our reason for each element we incorporated into the design. The moment we finished our dialogue, our barber was enthusiastic enough to beat the paradox of choice and pick his favourite design. Our own experience showed us what we suspected all along. A brand&rsquo;s top two superpowers are the service rendered and the stories told. People won&rsquo;t connect with a brand, let alone a logo if they hate the experience they had there. An exceptional service creates a feeling in the air that customers can&rsquo;t understand and don&rsquo;t find anywhere else. This brings about retention, they keep coming back, curious to find out more. Why did they feel that way? How can they feel it again? What&rsquo;s in store that hasn&rsquo;t been seen yet? How does the brand create cool experiences? Strive to create a feeling that there&rsquo;s something about your brand that is unique, something transcendental.</p>\n\n<p class=\"h5 mb-grid-gutter mb-sm-5\" style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"Blog image\" class=\"mb-grid-gutter mb-sm-5 rounded\" src=\"/static/img/creative-agency/logo/adidas.jfif\" /></p>\n\n<p class=\"h5 mb-grid-gutter mb-sm-5\">Now for the second trait, A story. Stories move people, gets us to collaborate, humans are the dominant species today because we&rsquo;re the only species capable of cooperating The Nike SwooshThe Logo Doesn&#39;t Tell The Whole Story 3 in large numbers. We&rsquo;re able to do this because we tell stories that unite us. People won&rsquo;t connect with a logo until they&rsquo;ve been told the story behind it. Adidas is a good example, their famous three stripes, tilted to about thirty degrees to the left and shown in order of increasing height. This is intentionally made to represent a mountain. This would probably be strange to us at first sight. It&rsquo;s pretty austere. So here&rsquo;s the story behind it. It represents in the company&rsquo;s own words, &lsquo;It represents the challenges to be faced and the goals to be achieved&rsquo;. Well coming from a company with consistent successes like Adidas, that logo hits harder now. The logo didn&rsquo;t change one bit, our perception of it did. That&rsquo;s the power of a good story, now we see the cup as half full instead of half empty.</p>\n\n<p class=\"h5 mb-grid-gutter mb-sm-5\">At Soundclaz, we don&rsquo;t just design and advertise. We always make sure there&rsquo;s a story in there to tell and we always do our best to provide a service that&rsquo;s to die for. The logo is important, it&rsquo;s a compact pictorial representation of your brand&rsquo;s philosophy. The thing is, at first sight, it&rsquo;s not that great to most people outside your inner circle. Good service and an engaging story will change that. That&rsquo;s what should be worked on, that&rsquo;s what matters. These two things turned a bunch of stripes into an iconic symbol of excellence. The logo doesn&rsquo;t build the brand, the brand builds the logo.<br />\nSoundClaz</p>\n",
"Content2": "<p class=\"h5 mb-grid-gutter mb-sm-5\">It always happens. Whether you were sitting alone in deep thoughts, in the shower or even from a dream, we always get ideas. Some of them are so good that we leave the shower with lather still on our bodies till we have penned it down. We think of that idea, and we imagine what we can do with that idea, the amount of revenue it can generate and yes, the things we like to buy with that money. But very often, at the end of the day, we give up on the idea. Sometimes due to forgetfulness, but other times we don&rsquo;t know how to convert that idea into the business that we desire. Here is how to do it:</p>\n\n<p class=\"h5 mb-grid-gutter mb-sm-5\"><img alt=\"Blog image\" class=\"mb-grid-gutter mb-sm-5 rounded\" src=\"/static/img/creative-agency/blog/business_idea.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p class=\"h5 mb-grid-gutter mb-sm-5\">1. Write it Down: There is nothing more painful than a forgotten idea&mdash;especially when that idea is potentially worth millions. As humans, we are always constantly distracted by one thing or the other&mdash;schooling, work, children, among many others. And if we don&rsquo;t document these fantastic ideas, there is no way we can remember them. Remember, while ideas might just drop from nowhere, it takes a lifetime of constant development to build it into something.<br />\n2. Research: This is a very fundamental part of the ideation process. This is where you check the feasibility of your idea. Is there a market for this or not? What are the factors that I need to have before I commence with the idea? Does your target audience see this as a problem, and would your solution be useful to them? You can do this through survey, forms and interviews with potential customers.<br />\n3. Funding: Many people with ideas see this as the biggest threat to their start-up, which shouldn&rsquo;t be so. Creating something of value always involves a cost, but that thing of value would also generate a profit. With this in mind, there are multiple funding sources, including personal savings, crowdfunding, angel investors, bank loans, and many others.<br />\n4. Marketing: You have a product, but you don&rsquo;t know how to get it to your final consumer, this is where marketing comes in. The purpose of marketing is to ensure your audience can reach you, and your product&rsquo;s knowledge goes to them. Increased awareness equals increased sales, and that&rsquo;s why big brands still advertise no matter what. At Sounclaz, we handle that for you. From your product shoot to advert placement, we take the confusions and turn them into manifestations that give a clearer understanding of your product or brand with optimum promotion services.<br />\n5. Innovation: This is the threshold of all start-ups and a better way to make your work more efficient. What can you do to make your start-up much better? Opportunities can come in new products, new businesses, new market, new technology or modification of the existing product.<br />\n6. Persistence: Rome wasn&rsquo;t built in a day. The competitive strategy that an entrepreneur chooses will significantly affect his potential for success. If you desire to really make something out of the idea, you must sweat off on it. Every start-up is like a baby, and it must be adequately cared for and nurtured.<br />\n7. Take-off: Yes, it&rsquo;s time for take-off. You can keep planning and thinking about your idea, but if you don&rsquo;t set your plans into motion, it remains an idea. It doesn&rsquo;t help you create value or buy that dress. Only plans in motion can, and you should get to work on that!</p>\n",
  "Content3": "<p class=\"h5 mb-grid-gutter mb-sm-5\">Your customers are the bloodline of your business. They drive sales, increase awareness through recommendations and develop a lifetime commitment with your brand. And you wouldn&rsquo;t want to lose a single one especially when it reported that the average value of a lost customer is $243! Whether it may be a marketer or sales representative or receptionist that handles your customer&rsquo;s communication, it must be done right and effectively. Here are some techniques to improve communication with customers:</p>\n\n<p class=\"h5 mb-grid-gutter mb-sm-5\"><img alt=\"Blog image\" class=\"mb-grid-gutter mb-sm-5 rounded\" src=\"/static/img/creative-agency/blog/communication.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p class=\"h5 mb-grid-gutter mb-sm-5\">1. Listen to them: The average customer always feels the representative doesn&rsquo;t understand their plight. This might not always be true, but it can be improved. By building active listening skills, you are much able to understand your customer&rsquo;s need and attend to them appropriately<br />\n2. Be patient: While listening, you want to exercise patience. Most customers are unsure, confused or have a grievance, and it takes time to resolve this. You don&rsquo;t want to rush an explanation when they don&rsquo;t understand an offer. It&rsquo;s tempting to take short cuts when you re stressed out but remember you are their first point contact if business.<br />\n3. Use Analogies: An analogy is drawing a comparison between two different subjects to show a similarity in some respect. Analogies explain complex or technical issues quickly.<br />\n4. Follow-up: It&rsquo;s not just okay to solve customer&rsquo;s needs; you need to follow up on them. Find out if everything is OK a week or two after a sale. Is a customer satisfied? Are there any questions? But don&rsquo;t overdo it&mdash;you don&rsquo;t want to appear creepy! Ask them for reviews and referrals and don&rsquo;t forget to work on their negative feedback promptly<br />\n5. Emails Newsletter: Emails are still ever active in today&rsquo;s world, and newsletters keep them informed on your latest offers. You can share promotion updates, special discounts, bonus offers and giveaways easily straight into their inbox.<br />\n6. Engage them On Social Media: Social media is a handy tool for engaging customers. Creating Facebook, Twitter and Instagram business handles help them reach you from their accounts. This increases your connection with them which will enhance your customer retention.<br />\n7. Analyze the data: At the end of it all, you want to see the degree of responsiveness from each step. You must improve on the step(s) that drives your business more because customer retention is much more effective than customer acquisition!<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n"
